                    <p><code>HTML,</code> an abbreviation of Hypertext Markup Language, is a programming language for
                        creating electronic documents referred to as pages featured across the web. Every page has
                        multiple connections to hyperlinks or links to other pages. </br></br> All web pages across the
                        Internet have been crafted by the use of some form of HTML. It is an essential requirement for
                        browsers to learn how to display texts or perform the loading of different elements. </p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <article>
                <ul>
                    <li>Html is a programming language with an easy learning curve and offers easy usability.</li>
                    <li>The language is also platform-independent.</li>
                    <li>Html facilitates the easy addition of videos, images, and audio content to a web page. </li>
                    <li>The language can also be used for adding hypertext content to sections of text.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML is easy to learn and use –</strong> Most developers find HTML to be one of the most
                        easy-to-learn programming languages. Many developers are taught HTML before any other language,
                        and it is an integral part of any development course. HTML is easy to learn as it makes use of
                        simple tags, and there is no issue with case sensitivity.
                    <li><strong>HTML is free – </strong>HTML is a free language, and developers do not need to buy any
                        software to get started with it. The language does not require users to work with any external
                        plugins and software to access key features. This is why many businesses around the world rely
                        on HTML for fulfilling their website design requirements. It is possible to have entire websites
                        build in HTML. </li>
                    <li><strong>HTML offers support for multiple browsers –</strong> HTML is supported by the most
                        widely used browsers. Hence, if a website has been written in HTML, there is no concern related
                        to browser support. HTML websites can be optimized for the different browsers they can be loaded
                        from. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Not Enough for Dynamic Pages –</strong> Using basic HTML is not enough for facilitating
                        many of the features that modern websites offer to their users. Developers may find it difficult
                        to add dynamic content to web pages with HTML. They are required to learn other languages such
                        as JavaScript, PHP, or ASP. </li>
                    <li><strong>Limited for Displaying Content –</strong> HTML is also not an ideal choice for
                        appealingly showing displayed content. This is a limitation most developers are aware of. They
                        have to rely on CSS or Cascading Style Sheets to make HTML page content more appealing to the
                        eye. Web designers and developers are required to create and maintain two different file sets in
                        some cases. </li>

                    <p><code>CSS</code> is a programming language used for stating how documents are offered to users in
                        terms of layout and style. A document generally refers to a text file structure utilizing a
                        markup language such as the widely used HTML and others such as XML or SVG. </br></br> CSS is
                        used for converting a document to a usable form for audiences. This is particularly significant
                        for browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge built to deliver documents onto screens,
                        printers, and projectors visually.</p>

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Selectors –</strong> CSS selectors are tools for users to pick and handle different
                        elements on a web page. They can be referred to as structural components for performing matching
                        of attributes and attribute values. New selectors are capable of targetting pseudo-classes to
                        style URL-targetted elements. Selectors also encompass a checked pseudo-class for styling
                        checked elements, including radio buttons and checkboxes. </li>
                    <li><strong>Text effects and layout –</strong> CSS3 can be used for making different adjustments
                        such as text justification change, adjusting a document’s whitespace, and word hyphenation
                        style.</li>
                    <li><strong>First-letter and first-line pseudo-classes –</strong> CSS comes with properties that aid
                        in adjusting character spaces to enhance the visuals effect and placing drop caps at the
                        beginning of paragraphs. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CSS saves time −</strong> CSS code has to be written once, and the same sheet can be
                        used across several HTML pages. A style can be defined for each HTML element, and a user can
                        apply it for multiple web pages based on requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy maintenance −</strong> CSS code is easy to maintain and users can easily make
                        global changes to edit the style. Once changes are made, all web pages are automatically
                        updated. </li>
                    <li><strong>Changing web standards −</strong> HTML attributes are no longer used widely as more
                        users are gravitating towards utilising CSS. It is recommended that developers use it across
                        HTML pages to ensure compatibility with future browser releases.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cross-browser problems – </strong> Making CSS changes on a website can be an easy task
                        for developers. But, there is the need to ensure CSS compatibility after the changes have been
                        implemented, as the user needs to check if the browsers all display the changes similarly.
                        Checking across browsers is important as CSS functions differently across browsers. </li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple levels lead to confusion –</strong> The CSS programming language has multiple
                        levels, making it a confusing prospect for some developers. These include CSS, CSS 2, and CSS 3,
                        which all have slightly different specifications. </li>

                    <p><code>JavaScript</code> is a popularly used programming language that lets users implement
                        sophisticated features on web pages.</br></br> It can be brought into action anytime a page is
                        performing a dynamic action, such as showing periodic content updates, animated two-dimensional
                        and three-dimensional graphics, interactive maps, video boxes, and more.</p>

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Object-centered script language –</strong> JavaScript is an object-centered language
                        like Visual Basic and has concepts built around the concept of objects. Object-centered
                        languages are used widely for features such as polymorphism, through which an object can be
                        taken in multiple forms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Client edge technology –</strong> A web browser can be referred to as a client which is
                        utilized by a user. The data of a server is uploaded by a client and is then accessed by a user
                        after it has been rendered. A user can use a client or browser for browsing websites and
                        interacting with websites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Validation of user’s input – </strong>Validation of User’s Input, also known as form
                        validation, enables users to initiate client interactions through webpage form fill-ups. The
                        form details have to be validated by the client to validate the information provided by a user.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Server load – </strong>JavaScript is a client-side language that can reduce server
                        demands dynamically. Some applications can also require no server to function.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rich interfaces –</strong> JavaScript can be utilized for developing features such as
                        drag and drop functions for sliders. This can radically improve the user interface and user
                        experience on a website.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extended functionality –
                        </strong>JavaScript developers can extend web page functionality by creating JavaScript snippets
                        for multiple third-party add-ons.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Client-side security –</strong> JavaScript code executes on a user’s computer, often
                        leading to security concerns due to malicious activities. It is why many developers disable.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Browser support – </strong>JavaScript can be interpreted differently based on the
                        browser interpreting it. As a result, creating cross-browser code can be a challenge for some
                        developers. </li>

                    <p><code>React</code> is a programming language developed by Facebook for the creation of fast and
                        cutting-edge web user interfaces.</br></br> It is currently one of the most widely used
                        JavaScript libraries for the creation of web front ends, and a great option for full stack
                        development.</br></br>The programming language React is suitable for the creation of visual user
                        interfaces and data rendering for browsers. Front end web development is easy with React and
                        check below the core features, and advantages of this technology.</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JSX –</strong> JSX is among the syntax extensions of JavaScript. It is utilized with React
                    Native for describing the appearance of a user interface. Using this extension lets users create
                    HTML structures that exist in the same file as JavaScript code.</strong>
                <li><strong>Virtual DOM – </strong>React stores a lighter version of DOM within the memory, which can be
                    referred to as VDOM or virtual DOM. Users are able to tweak VDOM faster than DOM due to there not
                    being a need for screen drawing. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>React is an easy-to-learn language and also quite easy to use due to ample documentation, online
                    training resources, and tutorials. Developers who are familiar with JavaScript are able to gain a
                    thorough understanding of React in a short time. </li>
                <li>Virtual DOM is one of the key perks of the React programming language. When an application is
                    centered around user interactions and has regular data updates, developers are able to optimize the
                    structure to get the right performance. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic technology –</strong> ReactJS is a popular development choice but is also changing
                    all the time. It raises the bar for developers who have to put in the time and effort to learn new
                    changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor documentation –</strong> Some developers struggle to keep up with the frequent updates
                    of React documentation and tools with each update. Updating oneself can be difficult if the latest
                    documentation is not available for specific tools, leading to issues with development. </li>

                    <p><code>Vue</code> is a framework for the creation of user interfaces and is different from most
                        monolithic frameworks as it has been created to deliver optimal adaptability. </br></br> The
                        main Vue library is focused on a view layer and can be utilized easily, aside from being easily
                        integrated with other existing project libraries.</p>
                </article>
            </section>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Virtual DOM –</strong> Vue.js utilizes virtual DOM, which is essentially a copy of the main
                    DOM component, reacts to each DOM change, and can be availed as JavaScript data structures.
                    JavaScript data structure progressions and changes can be compared with original data structures.
                    The real DOM gets the final changes that users can view. </li>
                <li><strong>Two-Way data binding –</strong> VueJS comes with two-way binding due to its MVVM
                    architecture. Relying on the QRR helps to edit or assign HTML value attributes to accelerate HTML
                    blocks. VueJS features two-way communication to ensure that any changes made to the UI are relayed
                    onto the UI. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flexibility –</strong> Vue.js is known for the level of flexibility it offers to users.
                    Developers can create their own templates with virtual nodes in JavaScript, pure JavaScript, and
                    HTML files. This makes Vue.js an easy-to-understand option for those developers who use JavaScript
                    frameworks such as Angular.js and React.js.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-way communication –</strong> Vue js enables two-way communications due to its MVVM
                    architecture and makes HTML blocks easy to handle. It has a high level of similarity with Angular.js
                    in that aspect. Also referred to as 2-way data binding, it entails that any user interface changes
                    made by a user get reflected in data, and any data changes are reflected in the UI. </li>
                <li><strong>Great tooling –</strong> Vue.js is regarded as a top option for tooling and the latest Vue
                    3.x CLI is considered among the best JavaScript Framework tools for JavaScript framework. Developers
                    can jump into new projects by utilising built-in features like Linting, Routing, CSS Pre-processors,
                    State Store, Routing, PWA, TypeScript, and Unit Testing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Language barriers –</strong> Vue.js has certain language-related limitations that can hamper
                    the development process. The Chinese-American origin of this app means that it exhibits a Chinese
                    language preference over other languages. The problem arises because Chinese is not used around the
                    world. So, the framework being in Chinese is a definite hindrance to developers. </li>
                <li><strong>Over flexibility –</strong> The flexibility of Vue.js is also a bane for many developers and
                    can cause an issue that requires community help to get sorted. There can be cases where the
                    extensive flexibility of Vue.js results in more errors and unnecessary complications for users.

                    <p><code>TypeScript</code> is another of the top 10 front-end programming languages and a JavaScript
                        syntactical superset. Any code JavaScript code is considered a valid TypeScript code, running
                        across browsers as JS. </br></br> TypeScript is an additive language with a simple translation
                        layer and can be utilized in JavaScript projects.</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>TypeScript is the same as JavaScript –</strong> TypeScript is quite similar to and often
                    considered the same as JavaScript. It uses some of the components of programs that are borrowed from
                    JavaScript. Developers need to know the workings of JavaScript to get good use of TypeScript. This
                    is because TypeScript code is translated into JavaScript code before execution. </li>
                <li><strong>JS library support – </strong>TypeScript offers support for JavaScript libraries, and
                    compiled code can be adopted from any piece of JS code. JavaScript code generated from TypeScript
                    uses all of the current JS tools, frameworks, and libraries. </li>
                <li><strong>Rename Files –</strong> Users find renaming JavaScript files to TypeScript files quite
                    convenient. Any .js file can easily be renamed to a .ts file and compiled with different TypeScript
                    files. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strict typing –</strong> In TypeScript, elements that are defined in a way remain how they
                    were set. This is one of the most important advantages of TypeScript. </li>
                <li><strong>Structural typing –</strong> The availability of structural typing is essential for users
                    who intend to define used structures fully. TypeScript makes it easier for developers to rely on
                    designated structures. </li>
                <li><strong>Type annotations – </strong>Using TypeScript type annotations lets users explicitly specify
                    the type that they intend to use. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>TypeScript requires a high level of effort for code implementation.</li>
                <li>Support for theoretical classes is not readily offered by TypeScript.</li>
                <li>TypeScript requires a definition document for using an outsider library, and this document may not
                    always be accessible. </li>
                <li>Developers have to be mindful of the type definition nature in TypeScript. </li>
                <li>There is a requirement for converting TypeScript to JavaScript before running a program. </li>

                <article>
                    <p><code>Elm</code> is a functional language and framework geared towards front-end development. It
                        is the source of the Haskell programming language and enhances the maintainability of
                        JavaScript. </br></br>It is one of the closest options to JavaScript and a simple development
                        option. Elm features a framework architecture that is similar to Redux. </p>
                </article>
            </section>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functional –</strong> Elm offers clean functions, inputs, and outputs for the needs of
                    developers. Users derive a predictable output for any given function input. Code reasoning becomes
                    easier. </li>
                <li><strong>Reactive –</strong> Elm users can define UIs with a function due to reactive programming
                    support. They can create a reactive cycle through user action updates. </li>
                <li><strong>Compiles to JavaScript –</strong> Elm compiles code to JavaScript for HTML and CSS creation,
                    enabling browsers to run code. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Easy to learn – </strong>Elm is an easy-to-learn language, and developers can easily access
                    many tips, guides, FAQs, and other resources, along with a supportive developers community. The
                    number and variety of resources available are growing fast to aid developers.</li>
                <li><strong>Easier project support –</strong> Elm is known for the easy project support it offers to
                    users due to compilator warnings. The warnings stop any changes that an application cannot compile.
                    It leads to reduced project costs. </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
            <p>Elm may feel restrictive to some developers who are used to dynamic languages such as JavaScript or
                Ruby.</br></br>In addition, Elm does not have any support for each or for loops, and users have to do
                with some functions. Modifying a value present within a nested structure can be a hassle, as the value
                cannot be mutated.</p>
